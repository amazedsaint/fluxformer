## Abstract

We present **FluxFormer**, a Transformer-class architecture derived from first principles and engineered for **energy**, **memory**, and **process** efficiency. The model is built from three mutually reinforcing ideas:

1. **Local, linear-time transport** along the sequence using **split-step orthogonal (unitary) updates** on *paired channels* (“Q-walk”), extended to images via **separable 2-D Q-walks**.
2. **Sparse global hops** using **exact per-head gauge-biased attention** (ALiBi-style linear relative bias applied inside the attention kernel), optionally windowed for near-linear amortized compute.
3. **Exact reversible coupling** in the feed-forward path: an orthogonal 1×1 mixer plus **additive coupling** with a closed-form inverse, enabling activation reconstruction (low DRAM traffic). A **Top-K reversible MoE** variant adds capacity with bounded memory via a capacity factor.

From these axioms—**Locality**, **Causality**, **Reversibility**, and **Relabeling/Gauge Freedom**—we derive exact norm-conservation identities for the linear core, prove closed-form invertibility for the coupling segment, and analyze complexity. We describe a benchmark suite covering **long-context LM** and **2-D image tasks**, with standard metrics (loss, accuracy) and **systems metrics** (tokens/sec, peak memory, Joules to target). The repository ships with **tests**, **schedules** for window/k-frequency curriculum, an **energy logger**, and training scripts to reproduce all experiments.

## 1. Motivation and Principles

Modern Transformers excel at long-range modeling but pay a quadratic cost for global attention, and training often stores a large fraction of activations to support backprop—both factors dominate **energy** and **memory**. FluxFormer aims to reduce these costs without sacrificing accuracy by enforcing the following design constraints:

* **A1 (Locality & bounded signaling):** the *default* mechanism moves information at most one step per sub-update (a discrete light-cone).
* **A2 (Reversibility / information preservation):** core mixing primitives should be orthogonal/unitary so gradients are well-conditioned, and activations can be **reconstructed** in backward.
* **A3 (Causality & synchronous depth):** each layer is a small number of globally synchronous, **disjoint** local updates (“ticks”).
* **A4 (Relabeling / Gauge freedom):** models should depend only on **relative** phases or offsets; absolute reference frames are inessential and can be re-labeled (per-head slopes, edge phases).

These principles naturally generate the three components in FluxFormer.

## 2. Local Transport as a Split-Step Orthogonal Walk

### 2.1 Paired channels and Givens “coins”

Let the hidden state at position (t) be (h_t\in\mathbb{R}^{C}), with even (C). Group channels into (M=C/2) **pairs** ((a_{t,m}, b_{t,m})). Each sub-update (“coin”) applies a 2×2 **Givens rotation** on each pair:
[
\begin{pmatrix}a'\ b'\end{pmatrix}
==================================

\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta_m & -\sin\theta_m\ \sin\theta_m & \cos\theta_m\end{pmatrix}}_{R(\theta_m)}
\begin{pmatrix}a\ b\end{pmatrix}!,
\quad m=1,\dots,M.
]
Givens rotations are orthogonal, thus norm-preserving.

### 2.2 Split shifts (transport)

After a coin, perform a **split shift** along the sequence: for every pair,
[
a_{t,m}\mapsto a_{t+1,m},\qquad b_{t,m}\mapsto b_{t-1,m},
]
with periodic boundary or a causal padding. This is a **permutation**—again norm-preserving.

### 2.3 Two split-steps for isotropy + edge phases (relative position)

A single layer (tick) composes **two** split-steps with two coins: an “even” pairing and an “odd” pairing (implemented by rolling the pairing index by one). Between the steps, multiply pairs at position (t) by an extra rotation (R(\phi_t)) — the **edge phase** — representing **relative positional encoding**. Phases add on composition, just like discrete gauge links.

### 2.4 Temporal link and gauge-invariant nonlinearity

You may optionally apply a per-position **temporal link** (R(\alpha_t)) once per tick (book-keeping for time-varying relabelings). For nonlinearity, act on **pair radii** (r=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}):
[
(a,b)\ \mapsto\ \frac{g(r)}{r+\varepsilon},(a,b),\qquad g(r)=\mathrm{softplus}(w,r+b).
]
This **GaugeNorm** changes magnitudes (counts) but preserves phases (frames), honoring A4.

### 2.5 Exact conservation in the linear core

Coins, edge/temporal phases are orthogonal; split shifts are permutations. Therefore the **linear** core is an **orthogonal** map on (\mathbb{R}^{T\cdot C}):
[
|h^{\text{out}}|_2=|h^{\text{in}}|_2.
]
This implies stable gradients (Jacobian spectral norm ≈ 1) and supports **reversible** backprop.

---

## 3. Sparse Global Hops with **Per-Head** Gauge Attention

We use standard multi-head attention but apply **head-specific** linear relative biases (ALiBi-style) *inside the kernel*:
[
\text{bias}_h(i,j)= -,g_h\cdot \max(0,i-j),
]
under a causal mask. Each head learns its own **slope** (g_h) (time-scale), promoting **specialization**. To keep compute near-linear, we use **windowed** attention of width (W), applied **every (k)** blocks:

* Between attention hops: cost **(O(T\cdot C))** (Q-walk + mixers).
* At an attention hop: **(O(T\cdot W\cdot H))** (with (H) heads).
* **Amortized** cost per block: (O(TC) + \frac{1}{k}O(TWH)).

We include **schedules** to ramp window size (linear schedule) and adjust **attention frequency** (piecewise “k-scheduling”), increasing global capacity late in training while preserving early throughput.

---

## 4. Exact Reversible Coupling in the Feed-Forward Path

We construct an **exactly invertible** FFN block by combining a 1×1 **orthogonal** channel mixer (U) (product of Givens rotations) with **additive coupling**:

**Forward**
[
z=U,x,\quad
y_2=z_2+f(z_1),\quad
y_1=z_1+g(y_2),\quad
y=U^{-1}[y_1,y_2].
]

**Inverse (closed-form)**
[
[y_1,y_2]=U,y,\quad
z_1=y_1-g(y_2),\quad
z_2=y_2-f(z_1),\quad
x=U^{-1}[z_1,z_2].
]

With a custom autograd wrapper, we **reconstruct activations** in backward instead of storing them, significantly lowering **DRAM traffic** (energy) and **peak memory**. A **Top-K reversible MoE** version routes tokens to (k) experts with a **capacity factor**; overflow is dropped and outputs renormalized by kept mass to preserve expectation.

---

## 5. Full Block and Model

A **FluxFormer block**:
[
\underbrace{\big[\text{QWalk}\times q\big]}*{\text{local }O(TC)}
\ \to\
\underbrace{\text{TopoMixer}}*{\text{orthogonal}}
\ \to
\underbrace{\text{GaugeAttention}*{\text{(windowed)}}}*{\text{infrequent global hop}}
\ \to
\underbrace{\text{Reversible FFN / Top-K MoE}}_{\text{activation reconstruction}}.
]

A **FluxFormer model** repeats this block (L) times with token embedding in and a linear head out. User-tunable knobs: (q) (local depth), (W) (attention window), (k) (attention period), **schedules** for (W) and (k), and MoE options (experts, top-K, capacity factor).

---

## 6. Complexity and Systems Analysis

* **Transport + TopoMixer:** (O(T,C)), kernel-friendly (2×2 rotations + permutations).
* **Windowed attention:** (O(T,W,H)) at hop layers only.
* **Amortized** per block: (O(TC) + \frac{1}{k}O(TWH)).
* **Reversible coupling:** linear in (C); **no activations** stored for the invertible path.
* **Energy:** With reversible segments and fewer attention hops, **Joules/token** drop due to lower DRAM use and fewer matmuls; we include an **energy logger** (integrates GPU power via `nvidia-smi`) and reproducible scripts.

---

## 7. Theoretical Guarantees (Sketches)

**Norm conservation (linear Q-walk).** Each sub-step is orthogonal or a permutation ⇒ exact norm conservation; sitewise “continuity” identities follow by telescoping pre-shift edge fluxes.

**Exact invertibility (coupling).** The coupling map is triangular in blocks ((z_1,z_2)) and invertible via explicit formulas above; composing with an orthogonal 1×1 mixer preserves invertibility and Jacobian conditioning.

**Per-head specialization.** Given per-head slope parameters ({g_h}), attention weight distributions (p_h(i!\to! j)) differ across heads. In practice our NumPy benchmark reports a **positive mean KL** between per-head distributions and a mean-slope approximation, confirming specialization.

---

## 8. Benchmarks

We report *two kinds* of benchmarks:

1. **Mathematical invariants** (exact, hardware-independent): run as NumPy tests; they pass exactly to machine precision.
2. **Systems-level and task-level** (hardware-dependent): scripted runs that log **tokens/sec**, **peak memory**, and **energy (J)**, alongside accuracy/loss. These are reproducible with the provided training scripts.

> We refrain from fabricating numeric results in this manuscript; instead we **define** the protocol, **ship** the scripts, and include **mathematical checks** we ran here. You can execute the training runs on your hardware and drop the logs into the tables below.

### 8.1 Mathematical invariants (executed)

* **1-D Q-walk (linear core):**
  (|h|_2) conserved ((\pm 1\mathrm{e}{-15})) across layers; “light-cone” spread is ballistic.
  *(Script: `tests/test_numpy_qwalk_1d.py`)*

* **2-D Q-walk (images):**
  Same invariants extended separably along rows/cols.
  *(Script: `tests/test_numpy_qwalk_2d.py`)*

* **Per-head bias vs mean slope:**
  Mean **KL**((\text{per-head} ,|, \text{mean}) > 0) on random scores under causal mask, confirming head specialization.
  *(Script: `tests/test_numpy_perhead_bias_demo.py`)*

* **Reversible coupling round-trip:**
  Forward ∘ inverse ≈ identity to round-off.
  *(Script: `tests/test_numpy_rev_coupling.py`)*

* **Schedules parsing:**
  Linear window sweep and piecewise k-scheduling parse as intended.
  *(Script: `tests/test_schedules.py`)*

### 8.2 Long-context language modeling (run on your HW)

* Context (T=8\text{k}); vocab = dataset-specific.
* **FluxFormerV2** (per-head attention by default), (d=768), layers=24, heads=12, (q=3).
* **Schedules:** `--window_schedule "linear:512->1536@0.6"`, `--k_schedule "step:8->4@0.5;4->2@0.8"`.
* **Top-K MoE:** on (n_experts=8, topk=2, capacity_factor=1.25) *or* off for exact reversible coupling everywhere.
* Optimizer: AdamW (β=(0.9,0.95), wd=0.02); cosine LR; grad clip=1.0; bf16 if available.

## 10. Ablations

We recommend the following minimal set:

1. **Remove per-head bias** (replace with mean slope) ⇒ expect reduced specialization, slight loss increase on long contexts.
2. **Disable schedules** (constant small W, large k) ⇒ faster early training but lower final accuracy; the converse hurts early throughput.
3. **Replace reversible coupling with dense FFN** ⇒ higher peak memory and Joules due to activation saves, similar loss if parameter count is matched.
4. **Turn off MoE** ⇒ reduces capacity/token but lowers routing overhead; useful on smaller datasets.

---

## 11. Limitations and Extensions

* Per-head bias still uses the standard attention dataflow; further **kernel fusion** and INT8/FP8 quantization are possible with Triton.
* 2-D transport is separable; for irregular domains, extend to **graph Q-walks** with edge phases on graph links.
* MoE routing can be enhanced with load balancing losses and explicit overflow queues.

---

## 12. Conclusion

FluxFormer shows that a **discrete-first**, **reversible**, and **gauge-aware** design can deliver a **near-linear** default path for sequence and image modeling while preserving long-range capacity through **sparse, per-head biased attention**. Exact reversible coupling reduces activation memory (and thus **energy**) without sacrificing expressivity. The codebase is engineered for **reproducibility** and **measurement** so you can quantify **Joules-to-target** alongside standard accuracy metrics.

## Appendix A — Core Equations

1. **Q-walk tick (1-D)**:
   [
   h \xrightarrow{R(\alpha)} h \xrightarrow{R(\Theta^{(e)})} h \xrightarrow{\text{split}} h \xrightarrow{\text{odd-roll}+R(\Theta^{(o)})} h \xrightarrow{\text{odd-unroll}} h \xrightarrow{R(\phi)} h \xrightarrow{\text{split}} h \xrightarrow{\text{GaugeNorm}} h.
   ]

2. **Per-head bias**:
   [
   \mathrm{Attn}_h(i!\to! j)\ \propto\ \exp\Big(\frac{\langle q_i,k_j\rangle}{\sqrt{d_h}} - g_h\cdot \max(0,i-j)\Big).
   ]

3. **Reversible coupling forward/inverse**: as in §4.

---

## Appendix B — FLOPs / Bytes (rough)

* **Q-walk + TopoMixer:** (\approx 4,T,C) mul-adds per sub-update (pairwise 2×2).
* **Attention hop:** (H\big(TW d_h + T W d_h\big)) ≈ (2HTW d_h), with window (W).
* **Amortized per block:** (O(TC) + \frac{1}{k} O(TW H d_h)).

---

## Appendix C — Implementation Notes

* Per-head bias is implemented **inside** the attention kernel (see `fluxformer/attn_ph.py`).
* Exact reversible coupling uses **closed-form inverse** (`fluxformer/rev_coupling.py`); the training wrapper reconstructs inputs during backward.
* Schedules are parsed from human-readable strings (e.g., `linear:512->1536@0.6`, `step:8->4@0.5;4->2@0.8`).
